# Fruity

> An imcomplete game from a complete idea.

## Summary

Fruity is the fruit of a #1 hour game challenge.
In short words, it was built in an hour. Everything, from the art
to the code and engine configurations. The engine used was
Unity.

## Note

Game has no music, nor polishing of assets and code. It was a fun experience from which I learned a lot from rushing to get a game running in one hour.
